==== Section 2: Basic Git ====

git init
	first step in every project

git status
	tells us the status of our working directory
	compares wooden and cardboard box
		difference will be in red
			- doesnt just track files, also changes in the files
			- this means if you made changes to a file when the file is not in the wooden box, there is discrepancy between
			the version of this in cardboard box, and the current version.
			- in this case, you need to add the file again.
	compares cardboard and metal box
		difference will be in green

git config --global user.name, user.email, add colour etc
	do it once for every device

git add [filename.extension]
	tells git to start tracking a file
	files moves from cardboard to wooden box

git add *.extension == git add .
	adds everything in directory

git add a*
	adds everything that starts with a

git add *i*
	adds everything that contains i

git reset HEAD
	undoes the latest? change

git commit -m "message"
	commit changes to the repository (all files that are green)
	moves stuff from wooden box to metal box :D
	message tells you (and perhaps git) why you are doing this/ what you are doing

git diff
	shows changes between working directories
	staging area(wooden box) and repo(metal box)

git log
	shows history of changes/ commits

git log --oneline

==== Git Summary ====

Commit:
	(v) finalise changes in repo
	(n) the final change in the repo

add and commit to be done separately for reasons

Basic git workflow:

1. Change
2. Stage (Add)
3. Finalse (Commit)

==== Section 3: Time travelling and multiverse ====

git checkout [commit-id]
	- switches workspace to the version at that commit-id
	- even if you enter the commit-id of the master, git will not show master.
	It's just paranoid xD

git checkout master
	goes directly to most recent commit
	when you do this, git will prompt to ask if you want to discard changes you made "in the past", if any

git log --all
	shows all changes

==== Section 4: social git = git + syncing ====

git clone
	downloads the repo from an online git platform

git push
	push changes to online server

==== Branches ====

git branch
	list branches in repo

git branch [branch-name]
	creates new branch with name [branch-name] from current branch
	without doing anything in new branch, they are considered the same

git diff [source branch name] [destination branch name]
	shows you what will be lost/ changed if you move from source to dest

git checkout [branch-name]
	switch to an existing branch [branch-name]

git checkout [branch-name^]
	the caret refers git to the parent of the commit of [branch-name]
