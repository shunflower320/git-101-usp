==== Section 1: Command Line ====

mkdir [directory-name]
	make new folder with name [directory-name]

ls
	displays a list of files and folders in the current folder

cd [directory-name]
	go into [directory-name]

touch [file.extension]
	creates a new file with name [file.extension]

cat [filename]
	displays contents of the file

pwd
	displays the current working directory

ctrl+l
	clears screen

rm *.extension
	removes everythinggggg

==== Section 2: Basic Git ====

git init
	first step in every project

git status
	tells us the status of our working directory
	compares wooden and cardboard box
		difference will be in red
			- doesnt just track files, also changes in the files
			- this means if you made changes to a file when the file is not in the wooden box, there is discrepancy between
			the version of this in cardboard box, and the current version.
			- in this case, you need to add the file again.
	compares cardboard and metal box
		difference will be in green

git config --global user.name, user.email, add colour etc
	do it once for every device

git add [filename.extension]
	tells git to start tracking a file
	files moves from cardboard to wooden box

git add *.extension == git add .
	adds everything in directory

git add a*
	adds everything that starts with a

git add *i*
	adds everything that contains i

git commit -m "message"
	commit changes to the repository (all files that are green)
	moves stuff from wooden box to metal box :D
	message tells you (and perhaps git) why you are doing this/ what you are doing

git diff
	shows changes between working directories
	staging area(wooden box) and repo(metal box)

git log
	shows history of changes/ commits

git log --oneline
	shows history on one line

==== Git Summary ====

Commit:
	(v) finalise changes in repo
	(n) the final change in the repo

add and commit to be done separately for reasons

Basic git workflow:

1. Change
2. Stage (Add)
3. Finalse (Commit)

==== Section 3: Time travelling and multiverse ====

git checkout [commit-id]
	- switches workspace to the version at that commit-id
	- even if you enter the commit-id of the master, git will not show master.
	It's just paranoid xD

git checkout master
	goes directly to most recent commit
	when you do this, git will prompt to ask if you want to discard changes you made "in the past", if any

git log --all
	shows all changes

==== Section 4: social git = git + syncing ====

git clone
	downloads the repo from an online git platform

git push
	push changes to online server

==== Branches ====

git branch
	list branches in repo

git branch [branch-name]
	creates new branch with name [branch-name] from current branch
	without doing anything in new branch, they are considered the same

git branch -f [branch-name] [commit-name]
	forces a branch of [branch-name] to be assigned to commit of [commit-name]

git diff [source branch name] [destination branch name]
	shows you what will be lost/ changed if you move from source to dest

git checkout [branch-name]
	switch to an existing branch [branch-name] (that branch then becomes HEAD)

==== Section 5: try.github.io ====
git checkout [branch-name^]
	the caret refers git to the parent of the commit of [branch-name]

git checkout HEAD^
	goes back in time to the parent of HEAD, which will subsequently become the HEAD
	need not specify name of HEAD
	by default HEAD is the current directory u are at

git checkout ~<number>
	<number> is optional
		if specified, git directly move <number> levels up in the commit tree

git reset [commit reference]
	moves HEAD to specified commit reference
		- commit reference could be commit hash (the long string of letters n numbers)
		or could be sth like HEAD~1, which would mean moving HEAD to parent of HEAD

git revert [commit]
	creates a new commit with the changes being undoing commits of HEAD	
	this new commit can be pushed to be shared with others working on remote branches
		1 checkout remote branch
		2 revert remote branch

==== Cherry-pick ====

git cherry-pick <commit 1> <commit 2> ...
	copies the stated series of commits under HEAD

==== Interactive Rebase ====

git rebase -i [commit reference]
	- the specified commit is the latest commit to be not involved in the rebasing
		ie all the commits that will be copied are after this one, and will be copied to below this
		this one cannot be skipped
	- will open a UI window for you to reorder or omit commits from the commits below the specified commit
